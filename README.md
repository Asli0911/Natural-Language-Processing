# Natural-Language-Processing

## Sentiment Analysis and Classification Project

This analysis will focus on using Natural Language techniques to find broad trends in the written thoughts of the customers. The goal in this project is to predict whether customers recommend the product they purchased using the information in their review text.

First, I extracted useful information from the Review Text variable using text mining techniques. Then I converted text files into numeric feature vectors to run machine learning algorithms.

In this project, I built sentiment classification models using algorithms Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Ada Boosting.

Additionally, I used K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree Clasification models on some of the numeric features and received some exciting scores. Maybe sometimes numbers tell more than words:)  

What do you think?
